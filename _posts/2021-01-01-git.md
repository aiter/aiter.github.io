## Concept

* working directory / working tree

> Unstaged changes exist in our Working Directory, but Git hasnâ€™t recorded them into its version history yet.

* index/staged

* HEAD

> a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

## git diff

`git diff`  View difference between Stage and Working Directory
`git diff --staged` View difference between HEAD and Stage  `--staged is a synonym of --cached`
`git diff HEAD`  View difference between HEAD and Working Directory
`git diff commmit-1  commit-2` View difference between commmit-1 and commmit-2
