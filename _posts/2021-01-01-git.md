## Concept

* SCM: Software Configuration Management
* VCS: Version Control Systems

> Version Control Systems are just that, software that provides versioning functionality (Git, Subversion, TFS Version Control) all fall into this category.
>
> Software Configuration Management is a broader term that encompasses all the processes needed to build, package, and deploy software -- this includes Version Control Systems. It does not refer to software per se.

* working directory / working tree

> Unstaged changes exist in our Working Directory, but Git hasnâ€™t recorded them into its version history yet.

* index/staged

* HEAD

> a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

## git diff

`git diff HEAD`  View difference between HEAD and Working Directory
`git diff commmit-1  commit-2` View difference between commmit-1 and commmit-2
