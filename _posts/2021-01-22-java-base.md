## Inheritance [1/4]

subclass
superclass
The super keyword

IS-A Relationship

## Polymorphism  [2/4]

### Virtual Methods

overridden methods /virtual method invocation

## Abstraction  [3/4]

## Encapsulation  [4/4]

* The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
* A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.

Abstract Class
Interfaces

## PECS

Producer extends and Consumer super

## Java SE

* JVM、 language、library features(API)
* JSR-->多个features/enhancements(JEPs)

primitive types

* numberic types
  * integral types
    * byte 8-bit
    * short 16-bit( from -32768 to 32767 (-2 to 2 - 1), inclusive)
    * int 32-bit
    * long 64-bit
    * char 16-bit unsigned integers(from 0 to 65535 inclusive)
  * floating-point types
    * float
    * double
    positive and negative zeros
* boolean type
  * true and false
* returnAddress type
 pointers to the opcodes of JVM instructions.
reference types

## Callable Future

Callable  call()

## lock and monitor – Java Concurrency

## How to work with wait(), notify() and notifyAll()

## Difference between sleep() and wait()

* wait() – Call on an object; current thread must synchronize on the lock object.
* sleep() – Call on a Thread; always currently executing thread.

## CAS Algorithm

## Thread Safety

## ThreadFactory

## CountDownLatch

## BlockingQueue

## forkjoin

The ForkJoinPool is basically a specialized implementation of ExecutorService

* java.util.Arrays class for its parallelSort() methods
* Stream.parallel()

## java14

* record
* switch
* NPE

## jdk 16

* ZGC: Concurrent Thread-Stack Processing

* Mercurial to Git？ why
* JEP 380: Unix-Domain Socket Channels

> For local, inter-process communication, Unix-domain sockets are both more secure and more efficient than TCP/IP loopback connections.

### Specification

* features
  * It requires two or more weeks of development effort to design and implement,
  * It is a significant change worthy of wide review, or
  * It is in high demand by the Java community.
* enhancements (除了features就是enhancement)

### Specification的结构

* API features,
* enhancements,
* clarifications,
* bug fixes.

* Annex 1 is the complete Java SE 14 【API Specification】
* Annex 2 is an annotated API specification showing the 【exact differences】 relative to Java SE XX(previous)
* Annex 3 The Java Language Specification and The Java Virtual Machine Specification
* Annex 4 Java Object Serialization Specification in connection with preview features in Java SE 14.
