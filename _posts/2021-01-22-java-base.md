## Inheritance [1/4]

subclass
superclass
The super keyword

IS-A Relationship

## Polymorphism  [2/4]

### Virtual Methods

overridden methods /virtual method invocation

## Abstraction  [3/4]

## Encapsulation  [4/4]

* The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
* A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.

Abstract Class
Interfaces

## PECS

## lock and monitor – Java Concurrency

## How to work with wait(), notify() and notifyAll()

## Difference between sleep() and wait()

* wait() – Call on an object; current thread must synchronize on the lock object.
* sleep() – Call on a Thread; always currently executing thread.

## CAS Algorithm

## Thread Safety

## ThreadFactory

## CountDownLatch

## BlockingQueue

  numeric types:
    byte,

    int,
    long,
    char,
    float, # floating-point

Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values

* Objects
An object is a class instance or an array.

Each object is associated with a monitor, which is used by synchronized methods and the synchronized statement to provide control over concurrent access to state by multiple threads

Reifiable types

> available at run time.

Raw Types

Variables

A variable is a storage location and has an associated type, sometimes called its compile-time type, that is either a primitive type or a reference type

* a variable is cheched at compile time. but, arrays, a run-time check ia made.
* There are eight kinds of variables
  * static or an interface declaration
  * whithout using the keywork static
  * Array components
  * Method parameters
  * Constructor prameters
  * Lambda parameters
  * Exception parameter
  * Local variables

```java
class Point {
    static int numPoints;   // numPoints is a class variable
    int x, y;               // x and y are instance variables
    int[] w = new int[10];  // w[0] is an array component
    int setX(int x) {       // x is a method parameter
        int oldx = this.x;  // oldx is a local variable
        this.x = x;
        return oldx;
    } 
}
```
