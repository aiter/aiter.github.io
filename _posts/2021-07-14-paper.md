## Scheduling

Borg, Omega, and Kubernetes

* Application environment

> * Containers as the unit of management

An Overview of Openstack Architecture

Don’t make the container system manage port numbers
Don’t just number containers: give them labels

Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg

> hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many thousands of differ- ent applications, across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines.
(1) hides the details of resource management and failure handling so its users can focus on application development instead;
(2) operates with very high reliability and availability, and supports applica- tions that do the same;
(3) lets us run workloads across tens of thousands of machines effectively.

workload

* long-running
* batch jobs(short-term)

Constraints can be hard or soft;
resource requirements

2.5 Priority, quota, and admission control

Omega: flexible, scalable schedulers for large compute clusters  调度器扩展

> * 并行parallelism
> * 共享状态 shared state (集群中的所有资源，相对于资源分组给不同的调度器)
> * 无锁的乐观并行控制

monolithic cluster scheduler architectures. 整体的；巨石的，庞大的；完全统一的
集群的增大，使调度器更加复杂，也容易遇到调度器瓶颈
双层调度器，资源管理器保证并行的数据一致性,  Mesos [13] and Hadoop-on-Demand [4]

Omega: shared state, using lock-free optimistic concurrency control
需求

* 利用率要高（high resource utilization）
* 用户要求的约束（user-supplied placement constraints）
* 快速决策 （rapid decision making）
* 各种级别的公平性 （various degrees of “fairness” ）
* 商业重要性 （business importance）
* 健壮性和可用性

混布(batch and low-latency jobs)
问题：增加了复杂度

types of jobs,
flexibly support job-specific policies,
scale to an ever-growing amount of scheduling work

pessimistic approach: a particular resource is only made available to one scheduler at a time
optimistic approach: detects the (hopefully rare) conflicts, and undoes one or more of the conflicting claims. The optimistic approach increases parallelism, but potentially increases the amount of wasted scheduling work if conflicts occur too frequently. 

### Two-level scheduling

Mesos [13] and Hadoop-on-Demand (HOD)  YARN

### Shared-state scheduling

Omega

There is no central resource allocator in Omega

Each scheduler is given a private, local, frequently-updated copy of cell state that it uses for making scheduling decisions.

50–70% of MapRe- duce jobs can benefit from acceleration using opportunistic resources
