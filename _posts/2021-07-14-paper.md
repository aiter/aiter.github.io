Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg

> hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many thousands of differ- ent applications, across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines.
(1) hides the details of resource management and failure handling so its users can focus on application development instead;
(2) operates with very high reliability and availability, and supports applica- tions that do the same;
(3) lets us run workloads across tens of thousands of machines effectively.
